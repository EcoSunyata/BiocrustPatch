# Spatial and Temporal Scale-Dependent Feedbacks Govern Dynamics of Biocrusts in Drylands

This repository contains the R code for simulating the self-organization of biocrusts in dryland ecosystems. The project is structured to facilitate understanding and reproducibility of the results of the study outlined in our publication.

## Project Structure

- **TwoComponent.R**: This file contains the core code for simulating the self-organization of biocrusts with two components (e.g., mosses and lichens). It includes the main functions and algorithms used to model the interactions and dynamics between these components.

- **OneComponent.R**: This file includes the code for simulating the self-organization of a single component of biocrusts. It is useful for understanding the basic dynamics of biocrusts without the complexity of interactions between different types.

- **Library.R**: This file lists all the necessary R packages and functions that are required for running the simulations. It serves as a central location for managing dependencies and ensuring that all required libraries are loaded.


## Dependencies

The project relies on several R packages. You can find the list of all required packages in `Library.R`. Ensure that these packages are installed in your R environment before running the simulations.
